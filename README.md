## üé®UI Plan
#### Layout Overview

The app's graphical user interface (GUI) is structured to provide a clean, user-friendly experience where each action has its own section for input and controls. The layout is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily select and configure system actions.
##### UI Components
- Heading: At the top of the window, the title "System Action Scheduler" is displayed in bold and large font, providing a clear indication of the app's purpose.

- Action Sections: Each action (Shutdown, Restart, Sleep, Open URL) is represented by a section containing:

    Icon: A small icon visually representing the selected action (e.g., a restart icon for restarting, a power icon for shutting down, etc.). The icon updates dynamically when the user selects a new action from the dropdown menu. <br>
    Time Input: A text field where users can enter the delay time for the selected action. This allows users to specify how long they want to wait before the action is executed.<br>
    Time Unit Selector: A dropdown menu that allows users to choose the time unit for the delay, such as seconds, minutes, or hours.<br>
    URL Input: For the "Open URL" action, an additional input field is shown, allowing users to specify the URL they want to open in their default web browser.<br>
- Start Timer Button: A large button labeled "Start Timer" that, when clicked, initiates the countdown for the selected action. This button triggers the scheduling of the chosen action, using the time and unit specified by the user.<br>

##### UI Layout
The layout of the app consists of a single main window, containing the action selection dropdown, the icon for the action, the time input and unit selection, and the "Start Timer" button. The components are arranged logically to make it easy for the user to follow:<br>
1.Header at the top displays the app title.<br>
2.Action selection section allows the user to choose between Restart, Shutdown, Sleep, or Open URL from a dropdown.<br>
3.Icon display shows a corresponding icon for the selected action.<br>
4.Time input fields (text field and dropdown) for entering the delay.<br>
5.Start Timer button at the bottom to trigger the scheduled action.<br>
